assupmtion: sum of all ifs are exhaustive. == 1.

state transition always use if-then condition.
   e.g. s0 --> s0, s0 --> s1 : we have if c0 then s0; if c1 then s1
        s0 --> s0 : if c0 then s0, you can substitute c0 to true in this situation.
        s0 --> s1: if c1 then s1.  this one c1 is also true in fact.

but we preserve the condition in the original source if exists.
