Now, we want to make the app run forever. Even in some cases, it occures some problems and shut down. We hope it can be restarted automaically.

1. sudo npm install forever -g
   here '-g' means globally installing forever module. 

2. Command:
   1)start:
   forever start app.js
   2)stop:
   forever stop app.js
